Thanks for downloading cmsplugin-feed.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install


Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``cmsplugin_feed`` 
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on
your Python path; this is useful if your working from a Mercurial checkout.

Note that this application requires Python2.3 or later, and a functional
installation of Django 1.` or newer as well as a functional install of 
Django-CMS 2.` Final or newer. it also requires feedparser ::

    pip install feedparser
    
Setup
- make sure requirements are installed and properly working
- add 'cmsplugin_feed' to INSTALLED_APPS
- run 'python manage.py syncdb'

Settings
CMSPLUGIN_FEED_CACHE_TIMEOUT    (Default 3600)
